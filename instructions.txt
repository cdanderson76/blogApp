3.  USER MODEL


NOTE: YOUR '/backend/.env' FILE WILL BE NEEDED!!!


For this challenge, we have to define a schema to create users, and to retrieve the users
from the database.


A. Create 'backend/model/User.js' and start creating the user schema.  Use the following 
   to build it:

   name (required)
   email (required/unique)
   password (required/mininum length needs to be 6 characters)
   ensure that user creation will include a timestamp

   Export the model.


B. Create 'backend/routes/user-routes.js' and initialize express routing. Export it as well 
   Create 'backend/controllers/user-controller.js'

   In 'backend/controllers/user-controller.js' create a function called 'getAllUsers'.
   You will use the 'User' model in order to create a route within '/routes/user-routes'.

   If there are no users, return code 404 with 'No users found'
   If there are users, return code 200 with the users.


C. Import this function into '/routes/user-routes.js'.  You will use the 'get' method,
   along with the basic home route symbol.

   Turn the route within 'index.js' to a home route by changing its endpoint to
   '/api/user' by importing the router from '/routes/user-routes.js', and using
   it within the middleware within this file.

   Test the route in Postman. 

   If you test, and Postman renders what you see in Anki, then you've completed the 
   challenge.

   NOTE:  YOU DON'T HAVE ANY USERS AT THE MOMENT, SO IT SHOULD RETURN AN EMPTY ARRAY

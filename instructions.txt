4.  CREATE USERS


NOTE: YOUR '/backend/.env' FILE WILL BE NEEDED!!!


We are going to create users by way of a signup route.


A. Go into '/controllers/user-controller.js' and create a route that will create/sign up
   users.  This async function will be called 'signup'.

   For this you will have to get information from the frontend.  You will be looking to
   get what is in the schema you created in the last lesson: name, email, and password.
   How do you get all of these?

   Use a variable called 'existingUser' to find a user by email. 

   If a user already exists, return code 400 stating 'User already exists! Login instead'
   If a user doesn't exist, create the user


B. Create another try/catch and save the user to the database.  Now, import this function
   into '/routes/user-routes.js' and implement the appropriate request.

   NOTE: IF YOU TRY TO CREATE A USER NOW, IT WILL ERROR OUT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T KNOW WHAT
         TYPE OF DATA IS COMING IN...WHICH IS 'JSON'.

   Go to 'index.js' and fix this.

   You should now be able to successfully add users.  Check MongoDB and make sure the user
   that you created is there.  If there is a user, you have successfully completed this
   challenge.

1.  CREATE EXPRESS SERVER


A. Create a folder on the desktop and name it whatever you want.  Open this folder in
   VSCode and create your 'backend' folder.  Change directory into the 'backend' folder
   and create your 'package.json' file.


B. Create '/backend/index.js', and just add a simple console log to test it out.  In the
   'package.json' file, set it up to where it up to where you can import modules the 
   modern way.

   Create a 'start' script and a 'dev' script using nodemon.


C. Install the following packages:

   nodemon (as a dev dependency)
   express


D. Create your express server, and have it render 'Server is running!' to the browser.
   Also, use a varaible for the PORT number that you use, and log the localhost to the
   console.  

   When you click this localhost link, it should render the browser and its contents.
   When this is successful, you've completed the challenge.

2.  CONNECT TO MONGODB


A. Create a new MongoDB database within MongoDB Atlas (notes in your thumb drive).
   Install the following packages:

   mongoose
   dotenv


B. Create '/backend/.env' and '/backend/.gitignore'.  Configure the '.gitignore' file
   so that it doesn't push the '.env' file to the repository.

   Add the connection string and the port variable from 'index.js' into the '.env'
   file.  You can use 'MONGO_URI' as the variable.

   Configure the 'index.js' file to use the port number from the '.env' file OR
   have it use it from the local file if it does not find the '.env' file for some
   reason.


C. Create 'config/db.js' and use mongoose and dotenv to write an async function that
   will connect to the MongoDB database.  Use a try/catch to do so.  Within the catch,
   ensure that the process exits gracefully after an error.


D. Import the function that connects to MongoDB into the 'index.js' file, and use it
   to connect to the database.

   If the database connects and verifies connection just like in Anki, then you've
   completed this challenge
